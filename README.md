# Getter done

_To get the job done without procrastination_ - [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=getter%20done)

**Getter done** is a simple todo app for desktop to get ’er done!

Built with TypeScript, Electron and React. Project was set up mostly using the steps [found here](https://dev.to/franamorim/tutorial-reminder-widget-with-electron-react-1hj9).

## Scripts

- `build` — builds the whole project using webpack (webpack config can be found [in the root](webpack.config.js)).
- `start:ui:dev` — serves the UI on a local dev server on port 9000
- `start:electron:dev` — builds and runs [main.ts](src/main.ts) _without_ the UI.
- `start:dev` — builds and runs whole application in dev mode.
- `start` — builds and runs whole application.
